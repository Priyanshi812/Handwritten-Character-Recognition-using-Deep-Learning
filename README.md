# Handwritten-Character-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on understanding and evaluating a CNN-based handwritten character recognition model. The objective is to:
1. Analyze and visualize the architecture of a pre-written CNN model.
2. Collect and preprocess a real-world handwritten character dataset.
3. Train and test the model using this dataset.
4. Evaluate model performance using multiple metrics and derive insights.
5. dataset was very long so not able to upload
